    <p>Step 1: Heat the oven.
        Generally, the hotter the oven, the better the pizza will be. 
        The best oven temperature for pizza is between 450 and 500 degrees F (250 to 260 degrees C). 
        Pizza ovens cook at temperatures between 800 and 900 degrees F. 
        You can't get that hot in your home oven, but the higher you can go, the better.
        
        Place a pizza stone ($39; Amazon) on a lower oven rack. 
        Preheat the oven between 450 and 500 degrees F (250 to 260 degrees C) — the stone needs heat up while the oven heats. 
        Large, thick-crusted pizzas might need an oven temperature closer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) so the crust can cook completely before the toppings burn.
        
        <br><br>Tip: For a crunchy crust, preheat a baking sheet or cast iron skillet in the bottom of the oven. 
        Once you load the pizza, toss ice cubes into the hot pan to create a burst of steam.
        
        You know another way to get a terrific crust? Put your pizza on the grill.</p>
        
        <p>Step 2: Form the pizza dough and place it on a peel dusted with a little flour or cornmeal.
        If you like, lightly brush the crust with olive oil. This helps create a golden brown, crispy crust rather than a dry, dusty outer crust. 
        See how to make and form your pizza dough.
        
        Okay, the oven is hot, and the pizza's all topped and ready to roll. You need to grab your pizza peel ($22; Amazon), the large shovel-like tool that easily moves pizza from counter to stone without catastrophe. 
        Slide your pizza onto the peel. It's time for the oven.</p>
        
        <p>Step 3: Slip the pizza onto the hot pizza stone.
        Tip: Jiggle the peel to make sure the pizza isn't sticking. You want it to slide off the peel easily. If it's stuck, gently lift the sticky dough and dust with a wee bit more flour or cornmeal.
        
        Place the tip of the peel on the edge of the stone at the back of the oven. With one swift motion, jerk the peel back out from under the pizza. 
        If the pizza slides freely on the peel, it should land perfectly in the middle of the pizza stone. 
        If the pizza sticks to the peel, your toppings will slide off the pizza onto the stone, and the kids will hear you say those words you're not really supposed to use in front of them.
        
        Close the oven door, and let the pizza bake.</p>
        
        <p>Step 4: After 5 minutes of baking, check the pizza.
        If some spots are browning faster than others, turn the pizza; slip the peel underneath it like a giant spatula. Rotate the pizza on the peel and return it to the baking stone using the same swift motion described above.
        
        If you like, remove the pizza from the oven halfway during baking to brush more oil on the crust. This added oil will help darken the crust and make it even tastier. For a little garlic flavor, infuse the oil with minced garlic.
        </p>

        <p>Step 5: The pizza is done when the cheese is melted to a medium-to-dark brown.
        Color means flavor. Carefully remove the pizza with the peel and let it cool slightly. If you want, top it with additional fresh toppings. Slice with a pizza wheel ($15; Amazon) or chef's knife, and serve to your adoring crowd.
